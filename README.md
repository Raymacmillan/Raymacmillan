Hey folks! Software Dev here, with an insanely weird enthusiasm of tech. Currently exploring the depths of Web technology, mastering the art of React.js Next.js JavaScript, Java, Python and of course the HTML5 and CSS3. Looking forward to collaborating with other fellow dev mates so feel free to contact me. Very soon will also look into Data Science(Machine Learning) which is the core reasons I'm learning Python at the moment. Open to learning any near and Interesting technologies.

Also into Cybersecurity. Connect with me on Discord(raykun12) or X(RyoGenxx). Thanks!
